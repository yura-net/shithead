# Shithead Rule Discrepancies (vs. Wikipedia)

## Common Variations to Implement:
- Implement the "reverse play direction" rule for the 8 card. ??
- **Rule for 7s:** When a 7 is played, the next player must play a card with a rank of 7 or lower.
- **Rule for 5s:** When a 5 is played, it acts as a "reverse card," meaning the next player must play a card with a rank that is equal to or *lower* than 5. (cardgames)
- **Rule for 8s:** When an 8 is played, it is "transparent," meaning the next player must play a card based on the rank of the card *underneath* the 8.
- **Other Special Cards:** Consider adding variations for other cards, such as reversing the direction of play or skipping the next player's turn.
